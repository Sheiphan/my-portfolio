# Real-Time Computer Vision Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project delivers a production-ready computer vision pipeline capable of processing video streams in real-time. The system performs object detection, tracking, and classification with high accuracy and low latency, making it suitable for surveillance, retail analytics, and autonomous systems.

## Architecture

The pipeline consists of several modular components:

1. **Video Ingestion Layer**: Handles multiple video stream inputs
2. **Detection Engine**: YOLOv8-based object detection
3. **Tracking Module**: Multi-object tracking with DeepSORT
4. **Classification Layer**: Custom CNN for fine-grained classification
5. **Output Interface**: REST API and WebSocket for real-time results

## Technical Highlights

### Model Optimization

To achieve real-time performance, I implemented several optimizations:

- **Model Quantization**: Reduced model size by 75% using INT8 quantization
- **Batch Processing**: Dynamic batching for efficient GPU utilization
- **TensorRT Integration**: Accelerated inference on NVIDIA GPUs

```python
# Example: Model optimization pipeline
import torch
from torch.quantization import quantize_dynamic

model = YOLOv8()
quantized_model = quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)
```

### Distributed Processing

For handling multiple video streams, the system uses:
- Redis for job queuing and result caching
- Docker containers for horizontal scaling
- Load balancing across multiple GPU workers

## Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: 30 FPS on 1080p video streams
- **Latency**: Less than 50ms end-to-end processing time
- **Accuracy**: 92% mAP on custom dataset
- **Scalability**: Handles 20+ concurrent video streams

## Use Cases

### Retail Analytics
- Customer counting and flow analysis
- Shelf monitoring and inventory tracking
- Heat map generation for store optimization

### Security & Surveillance
- Intrusion detection
- Anomaly detection in restricted areas
- License plate recognition

## Deployment

The system is containerized and deployed using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  detector:
    image: cv-pipeline:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

## Lessons Learned

- GPU memory management is critical for multi-stream processing
- Model accuracy vs. speed tradeoffs require careful tuning
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms are essential for production systems
- Monitoring and logging are crucial for debugging real-time systems

## Next Steps

- Implement edge deployment for IoT devices
- Add support for 3D object detection
- Integrate with cloud storage for video archival
- Develop custom models for domain-specific applications
