# AI Chatbot Assistant

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent chatbot system designed to handle customer support queries and provide technical assistance. Built using GPT-4 and LangChain, the chatbot maintains conversation context and can access a knowledge base to provide accurate, relevant responses.

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Maintains conversation history to provide coherent, contextual responses
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Connects to a vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- **Multi-turn Dialogue**: Handles complex conversations with follow-up questions
- **Real-time Responses**: Streaming responses for better user experience
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks conversation metrics and user satisfaction

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and uses LangChain to orchestrate the AI pipeline:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    return_source_documents=True
)
```

### Frontend Interface

The React frontend provides a clean, intuitive chat interface with:
- Message history display
- Typing indicators
- Code syntax highlighting
- Markdown rendering for formatted responses

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Managing conversation context without exceeding token limits

**Solution**: Implemented a sliding window approach that summarizes older messages while keeping recent context intact.

**Challenge**: Ensuring response accuracy for technical queries

**Solution**: Integrated a vector database with company documentation and implemented source citation for all responses.

## Results

- Reduced customer support response time by 60%
- Achieved 85% user satisfaction rating
- Handles 1000+ conversations daily
- 70% of queries resolved without human intervention

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Integration with ticketing systems
- Advanced analytics and sentiment analysis
