# Deep Research Agent for Qubitz

## Overview

As Sr. AI Engineer at Cloud202, I'm heading the development of a sophisticated Deep Research Agent for qubitz - an autonomous AI system capable of conducting comprehensive research, synthesizing information from multiple sources, and providing actionable insights.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Research**: Multi-agent system that independently explores topics, follows leads, and validates information
- **AWS Integration**: Leverages AWS Bedrock for foundation model access and AWS Sagemaker for custom model deployment
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Uses LangGraph to coordinate multiple specialized agents working in parallel
- **Source Validation**: Implements fact-checking and source credibility assessment
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle concurrent research requests with efficient resource utilization

## Technical Implementation

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The system employs specialized agents for different research tasks:
- **Query Planner**: Breaks down complex research questions into sub-queries
- **Information Retriever**: Searches and extracts relevant information from various sources
- **Synthesizer**: Combines findings from multiple agents into coherent insights
- **Validator**: Verifies facts and assesses source reliability

### AWS Bedrock Integration

```python
import boto3
from langchain.llms import Bedrock

bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
llm = Bedrock(
    model_id="anthropic.claude-v2",
    client=bedrock_client,
    model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2048}
)
```

### Agent Orchestration with LangGraph

Implemented complex workflows using LangGraph for state management and agent coordination, enabling sophisticated research patterns like iterative refinement and parallel exploration.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Managing context across multiple research iterations without losing coherence

**Solution**: Implemented a hierarchical memory system with short-term (conversation), medium-term (session), and long-term (knowledge base) memory layers.

**Challenge**: Ensuring research quality and avoiding hallucinations

**Solution**: Built a multi-stage validation pipeline with source citation requirements and confidence scoring for all generated insights.

## Impact

- Reduced research time by 70% compared to manual processes
- Achieved 90%+ accuracy in information retrieval and synthesis
- Enabled scalable research capabilities for the qubitz platform
- Successfully handling 100+ concurrent research sessions

## Technologies Used

- AWS Bedrock (Claude, Titan models)
- AWS Sagemaker for custom model hosting
- LangChain & LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Python, FastAPI for backend services
- Vector databases for knowledge storage
- Docker & Kubernetes for deployment

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time data sources
- Multi-language research capabilities
- Advanced visualization of research findings
- Collaborative research features for team workflows
