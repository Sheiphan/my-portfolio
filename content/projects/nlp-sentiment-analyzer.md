# Multi-Language Sentiment Analysis System

## Introduction

This project implements a comprehensive sentiment analysis system capable of processing text in multiple languages and providing nuanced emotion classification beyond simple positive/negative labels.

## Features

### Multi-Language Support
- Supports 15+ languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Japanese
- Uses multilingual BERT models for cross-lingual understanding
- Automatic language detection

### Advanced Emotion Classification
Beyond basic sentiment, the system identifies:
- Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust
- Intensity levels (low, medium, high)
- Mixed emotions in complex text

### Real-Time Analysis
- REST API for single text analysis
- Batch processing for large datasets
- WebSocket support for streaming analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Model Selection

I evaluated several approaches and settled on a fine-tuned multilingual BERT model:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "bert-base-multilingual-cased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    num_labels=7  # 6 emotions + neutral
)
```

### Training Process

- **Dataset**: Combined multiple emotion datasets (GoEmotions, SemEval, custom data)
- **Training**: Fine-tuned on 500K labeled examples
- **Validation**: Cross-validated across languages to ensure consistency
- **Metrics**: Achieved 88% F1-score on test set

### API Design

The Flask API provides simple endpoints:

```python
@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_sentiment():
    text = request.json['text']
    language = detect_language(text)
    
    result = model.predict(text)
    
    return jsonify({
        'sentiment': result['primary_emotion'],
        'confidence': result['confidence'],
        'emotions': result['emotion_scores'],
        'language': language
    })
```

## Frontend Dashboard

Built a React dashboard for visualizing sentiment trends:
- Real-time sentiment charts
- Emotion distribution pie charts
- Historical trend analysis
- Word cloud generation for key terms

## Applications

### Social Media Monitoring
- Track brand sentiment across platforms
- Identify emerging issues or trends
- Analyze customer feedback at scale

### Customer Support
- Prioritize urgent or negative feedback
- Route tickets based on emotional content
- Measure customer satisfaction trends

### Market Research
- Analyze product reviews
- Understand consumer opinions
- Competitive sentiment analysis

## Performance & Scalability

- **Throughput**: 100 requests/second on single instance
- **Latency**: Average 150ms per request
- **Accuracy**: 88% F1-score across all emotions
- **Languages**: 15+ supported with consistent accuracy

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Imbalanced Data**: Some emotions were underrepresented in training data
   - Solution: Applied SMOTE and data augmentation techniques

2. **Cultural Nuances**: Emotion expression varies across cultures
   - Solution: Language-specific fine-tuning and cultural context modeling

3. **Sarcasm Detection**: Difficult to detect without context
   - Solution: Added context window and ensemble methods

## Future Work

- Add support for audio sentiment analysis
- Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis
- Develop real-time streaming analytics
- Create mobile SDK for on-device analysis
- Expand to 50+ languages

## Impact

This system has been used to analyze over 1 million customer reviews, helping businesses understand customer sentiment and improve their products and services.
