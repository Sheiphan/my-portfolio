# Lessons from Building Agentic AI Systems in Production

Over the past year, I've led the development of several agentic AI systems in production - from knowledge bots handling 100+ concurrent users to autonomous research agents. Here's what I've learned about building AI agents that actually work in the real world.

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems that can:
- Plan and execute multi-step tasks
- Make decisions based on context
- Use tools and APIs dynamically
- Adapt to changing situations
- Learn from feedback

Unlike simple chatbots, agents have agency - they can take actions, use tools, and work towards goals autonomously.

## The Reality Check

Building a demo agent is easy. Building one that works reliably in production? That's a different story.

### The Demo-to-Production Gap

**Demo**: "Look, my agent can search the web and answer questions!"

**Production**: 
- What happens when the search API is down?
- How do you handle rate limits?
- What if the agent gets stuck in a loop?
- How do you monitor agent behavior?
- What's the cost per query?
- How do you ensure safety?

## Architecture Patterns That Work

### 1. Multi-Agent Systems with LangGraph

For complex tasks, I use specialized agents rather than one monolithic agent:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Define specialized agents
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

workflow.add_node("planner", planning_agent)
workflow.add_node("researcher", research_agent)
workflow.add_node("writer", writing_agent)
workflow.add_node("validator", validation_agent)

# Define workflow
workflow.add_edge("planner", "researcher")
workflow.add_edge("researcher", "writer")
workflow.add_edge("writer", "validator")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "validator",
    should_revise,
    {
        "revise": "writer",
        "approve": END
    }
)
```

**Why this works**:
- Each agent has a clear, focused responsibility
- Easier to debug and improve individual components
- Can swap out agents without rewriting everything
- Natural checkpoints for monitoring

### 2. Hierarchical Memory Systems

Agents need different types of memory:

```python
class AgentMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        # Short-term: Current conversation
        self.conversation_buffer = ConversationBufferMemory()
        
        # Medium-term: Session context
        self.session_summary = ConversationSummaryMemory()
        
        # Long-term: Knowledge base
        self.vector_store = ChromaDB()
        
    def remember(self, query, context):
        # Store in appropriate memory layers
        self.conversation_buffer.add(query)
        if self.should_summarize():
            self.session_summary.update()
        if self.is_important(query):
            self.vector_store.add(query, context)
```

### 3. Tool Use with Guardrails

Agents need tools, but with safety measures:

```python
class SafeTool:
    def __init__(self, tool_func, max_retries=3, timeout=30):
        self.tool_func = tool_func
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.timeout = timeout
        
    async def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            try:
                result = await asyncio.wait_for(
                    self.tool_func(*args, **kwargs),
                    timeout=self.timeout
                )
                self.log_success(result)
                return result
            except TimeoutError:
                self.log_timeout(attempt)
            except Exception as e:
                self.log_error(e, attempt)
                
        return self.fallback_response()
```

## Critical Production Considerations

### 1. Cost Management

Agents can burn through API credits fast:

```python
class CostAwareAgent:
    def __init__(self, budget_per_query=0.10):
        self.budget = budget_per_query
        self.spent = 0
        
    def should_continue(self):
        if self.spent >= self.budget:
            logger.warning(f"Budget exceeded: ${self.spent}")
            return False
        return True
        
    def track_cost(self, tokens, model):
        cost = calculate_cost(tokens, model)
        self.spent += cost
        
        if self.spent > self.budget * 0.8:
            logger.warning(f"Approaching budget limit: ${self.spent}")
```

**Real numbers from production**:
- Average query cost: $0.05 - $0.15
- 90th percentile: $0.30
- Outliers (runaway agents): $2.00+

**Solutions**:
- Hard budget limits per query
- Timeout mechanisms
- Model selection based on task complexity
- Caching for repeated queries

### 2. Reliability & Error Handling

Agents fail in creative ways. Be prepared:

```python
class RobustAgent:
    async def run(self, query):
        try:
            result = await self.agent.arun(query)
            return result
        except RateLimitError:
            await self.backoff_and_retry()
        except ContextLengthExceeded:
            return await self.run_with_summarization(query)
        except ToolExecutionError as e:
            return await self.run_without_tool(query, e.tool_name)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            return self.graceful_fallback(query)
```

### 3. Monitoring & Observability

You need to see what your agents are doing:

```python
from langsmith import Client

client = Client()

@traceable
async def agent_step(state):
    # LangSmith automatically traces this
    result = await agent.run(state)
    
    # Custom metrics
    metrics = {
        "tokens_used": result.tokens,
        "tools_called": len(result.tool_calls),
        "latency": result.duration,
        "cost": result.cost
    }
    
    log_metrics(metrics)
    return result
```

**Key metrics to track**:
- Success rate
- Average latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Cost per query
- Tool usage patterns
- Error rates by type
- User satisfaction scores

### 4. Safety & Validation

Agents can do unexpected things. Validate everything:

```python
class SafeAgent:
    def validate_output(self, output):
        # Check for hallucinations
        if not self.has_sources(output):
            return self.request_sources()
            
        # Check for harmful content
        if self.is_harmful(output):
            return self.safe_fallback()
            
        # Check for accuracy
        if not self.verify_facts(output):
            return self.request_revision()
            
        return output
```

## Real-World Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Agent Loops

**Problem**: Agent gets stuck calling the same tool repeatedly

**Solution**: 
```python
class LoopDetector:
    def __init__(self, max_repeats=3):
        self.action_history = []
        self.max_repeats = max_repeats
        
    def check_loop(self, action):
        recent = self.action_history[-self.max_repeats:]
        if recent.count(action) >= self.max_repeats:
            raise LoopDetectedError(f"Action {action} repeated {self.max_repeats} times")
        self.action_history.append(action)
```

### Challenge 2: Context Window Management

**Problem**: Conversation history exceeds model context window

**Solution**: Hierarchical summarization
```python
def manage_context(messages, max_tokens=4000):
    if count_tokens(messages) < max_tokens:
        return messages
        
    # Keep system message and recent messages
    system = messages[0]
    recent = messages[-10:]
    
    # Summarize middle messages
    middle = messages[1:-10]
    summary = summarize(middle)
    
    return [system, summary] + recent
```

### Challenge 3: Inconsistent Tool Outputs

**Problem**: External APIs return varying formats

**Solution**: Standardized tool wrappers
```python
class StandardizedTool:
    def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            raw_result = self.tool_func(*args, **kwargs)
            return self.standardize(raw_result)
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "success": False,
                "error": str(e),
                "data": None
            }
            
    def standardize(self, result):
        return {
            "success": True,
            "data": result,
            "metadata": {
                "timestamp": datetime.now(),
                "source": self.tool_name
            }
        }
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Parallel Tool Execution

When agents need multiple tools, run them in parallel:

```python
async def parallel_tool_execution(tools, inputs):
    tasks = [tool.execute(input) for tool, input in zip(tools, inputs)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return [r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception)]
```

**Impact**: 3x faster for multi-tool queries

### 2. Caching Strategies

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import hashlib

class CachedAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = Redis()
        
    async def run(self, query):
        cache_key = self.get_cache_key(query)
        
        # Check cache
        cached = await self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return cached
            
        # Run agent
        result = await self.agent.run(query)
        
        # Cache result
        await self.cache.setex(cache_key, 3600, result)
        return result
```

**Impact**: 40% reduction in API costs for repeated queries

### 3. Model Selection

Use the right model for the task:

```python
def select_model(task_complexity):
    if task_complexity == "simple":
        return "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Fast, cheap
    elif task_complexity == "medium":
        return "gpt-4-turbo"     # Balanced
    else:
        return "gpt-4"           # Best quality
```

## Testing Agentic Systems

Traditional testing isn't enough. You need:

### 1. Scenario-Based Testing

```python
test_scenarios = [
    {
        "query": "Find recent papers on transformer architectures",
        "expected_tools": ["search", "summarize"],
        "max_steps": 5,
        "success_criteria": lambda r: len(r.papers) >= 3
    }
]

for scenario in test_scenarios:
    result = agent.run(scenario["query"])
    assert scenario["success_criteria"](result)
```

### 2. Adversarial Testing

Test edge cases and failure modes:
- Malformed inputs
- API failures
- Rate limiting
- Timeout scenarios
- Conflicting information

### 3. Human Evaluation

Automated metrics aren't enough. Regular human review of:
- Answer quality
- Reasoning coherence
- Tool usage appropriateness
- Safety and alignment

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Simple**: Build the simplest agent that works, then add complexity
2. **Monitor Everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure
3. **Set Hard Limits**: Budget, timeout, retry limits - enforce them
4. **Validate Outputs**: Never trust agent outputs blindly
5. **Plan for Failure**: Agents will fail - have graceful fallbacks
6. **Test Extensively**: Scenario testing, adversarial testing, human evaluation
7. **Iterate Based on Data**: Use production metrics to guide improvements

## The Future of Agentic AI

We're still early. The next wave will bring:
- Better reasoning capabilities
- More reliable tool use
- Improved multi-agent coordination
- Better safety mechanisms
- Lower costs and higher efficiency

But the fundamentals remain: build robust systems, monitor carefully, and always prioritize reliability over cleverness.
